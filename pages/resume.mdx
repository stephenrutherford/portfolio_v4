# Resume

> I'm a software engineer based in Barcelona ðŸŒŠ with 10 years of experience in the software industry.

My focus area for the past few years has been front-end development with React, but I'm also skilled in back-end development with Go. I am very quality-conscious because I spent my early career years in QA roles.
